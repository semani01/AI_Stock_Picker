<h1 align = "center"> AI Stock Picker </h1> 
While traditional investment in stocks is a laborious, arduous, confusing, demanding,
and time-consuming task, this project aimed to optimize, fasten, and smoothen the process.
With this project, an investing Artificial Intelligence has been created which could pick
stocks for the user. The stocks are picked based on the user's financial power.
To this end, core Python, a plethora of machine learning algorithms, and libraries have been used. This is a data-driven approach to the world of stock markets. The consumer gets to
choose how aggressive or defensive one wants to be when investing. The end user
needs to worry least about losses while celebrating assured profits with each investment
and trade. Value investing strategy has been devised which has been proven to work over
time, notably by prominent investors like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.
