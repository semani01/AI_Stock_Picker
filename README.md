While traditional investment in stocks is a laborious, arduous, confusing, demanding,
and time-consuming task, this project aimed to optimize, fasten, and smoothen the process.
With this project, an investing Artificial Intelligence has been created which could pick
stocks for the user. The stocks are picked based on the user's financial power.
To this end, core Python, a plethora of machine learning algorithms, and libraries have been used. This is a data-driven approach to the world of stock markets. The consumer gets to
choose how aggressive or defensive one wants to be when investing. The end user
needs to worry least about losses while celebrating assured profits with each investment
and trade. Value investing strategy has been devised which has been proven to work over
time, notably by prominent investors like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.


## What did the AI do?
* Selected stocks from March 2021 to be held for one year
* 2020 stock selection: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4234bd073d7c261b490789ddb59bf2adc3192b89cfc22ca84ed04d353cf69396
* 2021 stock selection: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/e01ce40222389e3af2a8356961f096033f2568d72202097f4aa779fb0ea60589

## Goals Achieved
1. Obtained Financial Data and Stock Performance Data of the previous years(historical data). 
2. Used existing algorithms to see if we have any predictive power between financial data 'now' and the stock performance 'a year from now'.
3. The financial data was used to create our features(X matrix) and the stock performance over the year after that financial data was released was the y vector.
4. Checked the models to see if they have predictive power, for the ones that did, used those models to create value-investing AIs.
5. Then, backtested the investing methods with the historical data to identify the best-performing algorithms.
6. Picked the winner and tweaked it further for performance improvements.
