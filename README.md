### AI Stock Picker
While traditional investment in stocks is a laborious, arduous, confusing, demanding,
and time-consuming task, we wish to optimize, fasten, and smoothen the process.
With this project, we aim to create an investing Artificial Intelligence which could pick
stocks for the user. The stocks for the user are picked based on his/her financial power.
We plan to use core Python, a plethora of machine learning algorithms, and libraries.
This is a data-driven approach to the world of stock markets. The consumer gets to
choose how aggressive or defensive one wants to be when investing. The end user
needs to worry least about losses while celebrating assured profits with each investment
and trade. We choose to devise value investing which has been proven to work over
time, notably by prominent investors like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.
